# 🎄 Trying to solve Advent of Code 2022 🎄

In this repository I want to show my attempts to solve Advent of Code 2022 problems using Python 3.10. Let's see how many days I am able to solve as a self-taught amateur programmer. My aim is to have fun and improve my little problem-solving skills.

Have fun, too!
